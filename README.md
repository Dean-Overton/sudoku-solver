# Sudoku Photo Solver

This problem was part of a Modern AI group project where we had to solve a sudoku puzzle from a photo. I decided to solve this problem using python and the OpenCV library.

The program should:

- automatically recognise a specific sudoku puzzle from the given image and extract relevant information.
- Use an algorithm to automatically solve the recognized sudoku puzzle.
- Display the solution to the recognized sudoku puzzle
