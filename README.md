# Sudoku Photo Solver

This problem was part of a Modern AI group project where we had to solve a sudoku puzzle from a photo. I decided to solve this problem using python and the OpenCV library.

The program should:

- automatically recognise a specific sudoku puzzle from the given image and extract relevant information.
- Use an algorithm to automatically solve the recognized sudoku puzzle.
- Display the solution to the recognized sudoku puzzle

### Set up

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the required libraries using the following command:
   `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Run the program using the following command:
   `python main.py`
